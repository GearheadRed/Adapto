Be hold

The ADAPTO!!

The thought behind the Adapto 3D printer is that one can use the same printed parts on printers with different types of materials(in the frame).

The history behind this design is that i got hold of some alu extrusions that was intended to be used
on a MendelMax
During the MM build i got so extremely annoyed with how over engineered it is so I decided to tear the MM apart in favor to make a design that only used 50% of the MM extrusions(that means i now have enough extrusions for 2 printers :D ).

I also designed the parts in a way that makes the builder able to use either Alu extrusions (20x20mm), wood, alu, acryl plates or plates made out of any material actually(if it is stiff enough). 

I recommend not using anything thicker than 20mm thick plates/stripes(due to the y motor mount and y idler parts)  and use max 34mm wide frame parts(due to the design of the feet`s), but thinner is ok if the material is stiff enough.

On the todo list is:

- make endstop holder for the X axes.(or maybe someone else makes one I like and I adopt it into the design? )
- Make endstop adjuster for the Z axes.(or maybe someone else makes one I like and I adopt it into the design? )
- make all the parts in OpenSCAD... << HELP ME PLEASE!!! >> ( i dont know how to openscad :/ )
- 

ENJOY!

If you decide to build one, please feel free to add a pin on the Adapto map.
